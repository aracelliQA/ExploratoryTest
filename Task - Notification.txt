TITLE - Add action notifications to newsletter subscription box.


DESCRIPTION


Business case: The functionality works as expected, but there’s no confirmation to let the customer know if the subscription was really made or if something went wrong.


To-do:  Add specific notifications to the newsletter subscribe actions. It must show up in three situations: the first one is when the user enters an invalid email such as “dfeijsj”; the second is when the user enters a valid email address, and the last is when the user enters an already registered email.


Content:  When the customer tries to subscribe to an invalid email, the notification text should say “Invalid email. Please check and try again!" in red font. When the customer tries to subscribe with a valid email, the notification text should say "Successfully subscribed. Thank you!" in green font, and if the email is already registered, the text notification must show the message “This email is already signed.” in orange font.
  



































Visual/Wireframes: The notification should appear right under the subscription box.
